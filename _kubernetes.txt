minikube start # start VM with kubernetes cluster
minikube status # check status and ips
minikube ip # get ip of server 

minikube dashboard # ! very good for seeing what's going on

# once up
kubectl cluster-info # info for cluster

kubectl apply -f {file / folder} # change configuration of cluster

kubectl get {type} # type => pods, services, deployments, storageclass, pv, pvc

kubectl describe {obj type} [{obj name}] # opt obj name 
                    # get details information about object

kubectl delete -f {file} # delete resource

## issue of fetching new images
kubectl rollout restart # new version, not tried yet since v1.15
kubectl set image {obj type}/{obj name} {container name}={new image to use}

# creating secret object type
kubectl create secret generic {name} --from-literal key=value # generic or docker-registry or tls

eval $(minikube docker-env) # connect current tty to minikube kubernetes-server

kubectl get pods > id
kubectl logs {id} # get logs | equivalent to docker logs {id}
kubectl exec -it {id} sh | equivalent to docker exec -it {id} sh

## theory
pods > run containers
     > good for dev purposes, but updating issues

deployment > runs set of identical pods
           > monitors state of each pod, updating if need be
           > good for dev and prod

service > has different types
    > NodePort for networking, keeps track e.g. of ips of pods,
        exposes to outside
    > ClusterIP, let's connect inside cluster as NodePort, no outside
